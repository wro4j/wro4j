This page describes some impact analysis over the performance of an application, before and after usage of wro4j.

= Details = 
We take as an example a typical medium size web application. We will test more pages. For each page, there will be a row containing results with typical css & js usage and with bold - using wro4j. 

|| Page No || Total Requests ||  Total size|| Time || YSlow Mark ||
|| 1  || 30 | *15* ||  350.1KB | *61KB* || 3.82 | *1.15* || F (47) | *C (70)* ||
|| 2 || 33 | *21* || 339.1KB | *75.9KB* || 3.1 | *1.7* || F (47) | *D (68)* ||

==Interpretation==
After integrating wro4j into my sample project:
  # The number of request dropped with 50%
  # The total size of downloaded resources dropped with almost 6 times
  # The YSlow Mark improved from ~50 to ~70

When using a fast internet connection, the benefits may be not so evident. In case of a very slow connection, like dial-up, the difference is much greater. There is a firefox plugin (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5917/) which can help to simulate a slow internet connection and to see how your application behaves with and without wro4j.
